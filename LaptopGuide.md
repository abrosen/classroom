# The importance of a decent laptop
You don't need a good laptop as a programming student, or a great one.
You do need one you can rely on, that you can get to work in about a minute or less of hitting the power button, and that has a battery life of lecture's duration.

However, not everyone can simply go out and buy a new laptop.
Sometimes we need to make due with what is availble.



TL;DR Students in my class are required to have a laptop.
Be happy with it.
If you are not happy with it, you should look at the options in this guide. 

If you cannot afford a laptop, please speak to me as soon as you possibly can.

# Using a Laptop for note-taking

Using a laptop to take notes may not be the smartest move in my class.
This may surprise you given the giant wall of text you just read.
However, numerous studies have shown that your ability to recall the stuff you're taking notes about is much better when you write it rather than using a laptop.
Even if recall was as good taking notes by hand versus by typing, your laptop is still a giant distraction machine. 
Exception:  Using a stylus on a touchscreen device is probably okay.  
Just remember your laptop is a distraction machine.




# Operating Systems
Windows vs MacOS

It doesn't matter, but programming on ChomeOS (a chromebook) or iOS (an ipad) presents unique challenges.
In the end, the choice of operating system doesn't matter for programming and merely reflects the environment and workspace you like the look of.

Or be daring and speak to me about installing a linux distribution.


### Best Linux distros for beginners:

https://ubuntu.com/

If you need a much lighter operating system for your old system:
https://lubuntu.net/



# Reliability
If you can't rely on your laptop, you should clean it, install Linux on it, or get a new one.

What do I mean by you needing a reliable laptop?
Too often I see students struggling with their laptop, waiting a long time for it to boot and load their IDE.

### Option 1: Clean
As you use your system, you fill it with programs you don't need.
This is especially true for Windows, but don't just pat yourself on the back because you use Linux.
If you're anything like me, you tinker with window managers and theming and random configs all the time.
However, if you're running Linux, you probably don't need this guide.

Most students with slow laptops are running way too many programs at boot and have tons of programs they don't need.





# Buying a new Laptop
## Specs 
- A decent laptop with some compromises and no issues will be 350-500
- A great laptop will be 800-1000
- Anything above is overkill for a student.



- CPU: get up to date generation.  As of July 2020, this is Intel 10th gen processors and AMD 3000 processors. 
- RAM: The amount of things you can have open at the same time.
    - 4GB is bare bones and will work, but will impact 
    - 6GB+ is great
    - 8GB is well more than enough.
    - You will not need more than 16GB if you do not know why people need systems with more than 16GB of RAM.

- Storage: The amount of things your computer can save locally. Storage size is not actually too high of a priority,  as so much can be stored/done online.  The most important thing is getting a SSD, as it is so much faster than a Hard Disk.
Solid state drives have no moving parts, as opposed to older Hard Disk Drives, which do.
This makes them fasters and more resiliant to damage.
 
 

- GPU or graphics: Integrated graphics is plenty fine unless you plan on playing games more taxing than Overwatch or Rocket League.


- Screen: Avoid TN if possible.  IPS is great. 1080p more than enough for smaller screens.


## Recommendations:


### How much money do I actually need to spend?

- Not ask much as you think
- 500-600 will serve you thru college.
- I made it thru my entire PhD with a $450 Asus vivobook with 4GB of RAM and an i5 4th gen processor.
- I only got a new laptop as it became too much to run both an IDE and record at a good resolution at the same time. 


## What should I spend more money on if I can afford it?
Things that make sense for a university student who is on the move.
- Lower weight
- Better quality screen
- Better battery life


### Actual recommendations:

#### Budget Choices

The below items should be more than capable of handling any programming work an undergraduate needs to handle

- 350ish
- Low price, IPS display
- Windows 10 s, https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4456067/windows-10-switch-out-of-s-mode 


#### Budget not a concern

Dell XPS [https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/dell-laptops/sr/laptops/xps-laptops]
- 900 and up
- Great value, great screen, lightweight

LG Gram
- Super light and great battery life.

Asus Zenbook
- At 800+, you can often find systems with a lower level dedicated GPU.
- Lightweight, great screen and keyboard.



#### Apple

With apple systems, the lowest specs are probably sufficient if you purchase a new machine.

https://www.apple.com/macbook-air/
- 900 with discount from apple
- light, great battery, great screen, all things that are great
- Not suitable for super high end tasks that you may encounter later, but those tasks are better left to a desktop.
