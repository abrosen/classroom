\title{Data Structures Questions}
\date{}

\begin{document}
	
	\maketitle
	
	In this exercise, you will solve a few problems that have been asked as interview questions.
	You may use Java's built-in data structures or the ones we've made in class (as java does not really have a Binary Tree, you may have to use the code from class).
	
	\newpage
	\section{Linked List Duplicates}
	Write a method which would remove duplicate items from a LinkedList.
	You may use additional data structures.
	
	
	\section{Stacked Queue}
	Create  a \texttt{StackedQueue} class using two stacks.  In other words, make a new Queue class named \texttt{StackedQueue}, but the only instance variables in it are two Stacks, and the methods, such as \texttt{enqueue} and \texttt{dequeue}, as implemented by pushing and popping items from the two stacks.
	The order that items enter are FIFO, just like a Queue.
	
	
	\section{Largest Smallest Item}
	Create a method that, given the root of a binary search tree, finds the largest item in the tree that is smaller than the root.

	\section{Permutation}
	Write a method that, given two strings, determines if one is a permutation of another.
