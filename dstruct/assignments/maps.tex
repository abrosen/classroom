	\begin{abstract}
		In this lab you create \textit{another} index for the complete works of William Shakespeare (\texttt{pg100.txt}), although you can use it on other files.
	\end{abstract}



	\section{Your Assignment}
	This assignment will essentially a quicker repeat of last week's assignment.
	Use a single \texttt{HashMap} to list the number of times each word appears in a document as well as what.
	Think about what needs to be the key and what needs to be the value.  
	Remember, you can use any object as a key or value in Java.

	You do not have to build a \texttt{HashMap}; use Java's built in class.
	Test your program on \texttt{pg100.txt}.
