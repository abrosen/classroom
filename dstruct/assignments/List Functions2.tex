\title{List Methods and Strings (Part 2)}

\begin{document}
	
	\maketitle
	
	In this exercise, you will learn to write static methods that use \texttt{List}s and Strings.
	Each of these is around the difficulty of some exam questions.
	If you need to make a new \texttt{List} as part of the method, implement it using an \texttt{ArrayList}.
	Read footnotes for hints.
	
	Your answers for this homework will be used for your next homework.
