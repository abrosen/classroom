# classroom
This is my public facing repo for my classrooms.  You can find code, assignments, and in class examples in here.  What you will NOT find are my answers or exams.

While this is intended as a resource for my students, it is public to anyone who stumbles upon it.
If you are antoher instructor, I merely request credit me in passing if you use some of my material. 

Classes are organized by grokable folder name, but not by course number, as those change from school to school.

## itp

## intro

## dstruct

# FAQ

### How do I get an A?
An **A** denotes complete mastery of the material.  The easiest way to get an **A** is to practice outside of class on problems besided the assignments I give you.  For your intro class, I suggest trying to solve some of your Physics/Bio/Chem homework with what you learn in class.  When in doubt, I can direct you to great resources.

### What is a .tex file?
A .tex is a LaTeX source file.  
I write my documents in LaTeX rather than in Word as a matter of personal preference.
I include them because you might find that interesting?

### I can't find file X...
Not really a question, but a common enough comment.  If it is code written in class, I may not have posted it yet.  Check the time of the last changes.
